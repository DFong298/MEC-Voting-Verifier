# MCMASTER ENGINEERING COMPETITON

## Creation
Our Voting Verifier allows for a easy registrion and voting process. 

First, create an account, and register by showing a picture of your McMaster student card and inputing. Using the library of **opencv** in **python** we read the persons name and last name as well as their student id number. This is then registred in our **SQL Database** which allows for an optimized and conivnent process later on. 

Concluding our voting process and allowing it to be swift and easy!
